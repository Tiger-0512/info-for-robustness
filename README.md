# Required files for robustness package
This repository is for [robustness package](https://pypi.org/project/robustness/) to create a custom dataset of ImageNet.<br>
[This link](http://image-net.org/download-API) to download these files is invalid, so I created this repository.

More information: [Creating a custom dataset by superclassing ImageNet](https://robustness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_usage/custom_imagenet.html)
